# LEETMETRIC
A simple webapp using HTML, CSS and JS which shows the numbers of solutions done by a user. 

This app uses the basic features of HTML, CSS and JS to create user input fields and a search button.
A user must enter a VALID USERNAME (ID should exist) and then click on search button.
It fetches the data using a proxy server(cors anywhere); this proxy server acts as a middleman between the leetcode server and the system.

We take the data specifically for our needs and then compute other things depended on it.

will work on more things on this project.
